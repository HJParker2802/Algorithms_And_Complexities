Description:
This program is a console-based application that reads, sorts, and
searches stock exchange volume data from multiple text files. The
program allows users to analyze stock trading activity by implementing
different sorting and searching algorithms.
By running the tasks you will see everything requested be done
By running the UI, the user gets to choose what they do at every step
 
Main Functionality:
- Reads stock exchange volume data from multiple text files.
- Sorts the data in ascending and descending order.
- Displays every 10th (for smaller datasets) or 50th (for larger
datasets) value after sorting.
- Searches for a user-defined value and returns its position(s).
- If the value is not found, provides the nearest value(s) and their
position(s).
- Merges and processes datasets for advanced analysis.
- Compares different sorting and searching algorithms by counting
their execution steps.
 
Input Parameters:
- Input file(s) or path
- Sorting and searching algorithm selection and related parameters (if
applicable).
 
Expected Output:
- Sorted data with selected interval values displayed.
- Search results including value locations or nearest available values.
 
Implemented Algorithms:
- Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. 
- Searching: Binary Search, Sequential Search.
